Repo created for the collection of the teams work.
For the writing of the SQL, I'd recommend using Sublime Text 3 (https://www.sublimetext.com/3), It highlights different key words to make the writing of the tables and schema very understandable, this is very useful considerin the amount of repeating there is when writing schema.
